In a world where data is the only currency that matters, defense is no longer enough. 
We are not here to read the rulebook – we are here to rewrite it. 
We are not looking for employees. 
We are looking for the 0.1%.

### // WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR:

We are currently recruiting for the following sectors. Qualification is not proven by certificates, but by results.

* **Offensive Cybersecurity & Red Teaming:** Penetrate before the adversary even knows a vulnerability exists.
* **Zero-Day Research & Exploitation:** We seek the vulnerabilities that don't have a name yet. Hunters, not collectors.
* **Reverse Engineering & Malware Analysis:** Strip foreign artifacts down to the bare silicon.
* **SIGINT & OSINT:** Become the echo in the digital noise. Find the signal, no matter how deep it is buried.
* **Cryptography:** Decrypt the unbreakable. Or create it.
* **ICS/SCADA Security:** Protect or neutralize physical reality through the digital domain.
* **DFIR & Blue Teaming:** Forensics for those who find traces that shouldn't exist.
* **Social Engineering:** Manipulate the weakest interface – the human element.

### // THE PROCESS:

The CST does not operate under conventional HR guidelines. Our selection process is discrete, efficient, and straightforward.

1.  **Initial Contact:** Send your CV or portfolio (encrypted preferred) to the address below.
2.  **Vetting:** We review whether your profile aligns with our national and global interests. Do not expect a confirmation email. If we are interested, we will find you.
3.  **Secured Communication:** Selected candidates will be contacted via secure channels (**CWTCH**, **Session**, or others).
4.  **Advanced Selection Procedure:** This is where we separate the script-kiddies from the serious experts. Your skills will be put to the test in an isolated environment.
5.  **Final Assessment:** Those who pass become part of a structure operating beyond public perception. Those who fail remain a footnote.

### // A FINAL WARNING:

We value discretion over talent. We are not looking for heroes; we are looking for individuals with precision.

> "We see what others miss. We act where others hesitate."

### // CONTACT

If you believe you possess the necessary cold precision, we await your message.
